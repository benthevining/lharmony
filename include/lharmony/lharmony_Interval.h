/** A class that represents a musical interval between two pitches.

	This class is meant for intervals that are an octave or smaller, and that can be expressed as a whole number of semitones.
	(Technically, the largest interval representable by this class is an augmented octave.)
	To represent intervals larger than an octave, use the CompoundInterval class.

	An interval is represented as a kind (unison, second, third, etc) and a quality (major, minor, perfect, augmented, or diminished).
	Note that not every quality is valid for every kind -- a "perfect third" or a "major fifth" do not exist.

	Here is a table of all valid kind/quality combinations:

	Kind as integer | Name    | Valid qualities
	--------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------
	0               | Unison  | Perfect, augmented
	2               | Second  | Diminished, minor, major, augmented
	3               | Third   | Diminished, minor, major, augmented
	4               | Fourth  | Diminished, perfect, augmented
	5               | Fifth   | Diminished, perfect, augmented
	6               | Sixth   | Diminished, minor, major, augmented
	7               | Seventh | Diminished, minor, major, augmented
	8               | Octave  | Diminished, perfect, augmented

	And here is a listing of all possible intervals that this class can represent:

	Name(s)                            | Semitones
	---------------------------------- | ----------
	Perfect unison, diminished second  | 0
	Minor second, augmented unison     | 1
	Major second, diminished third     | 2
	Minor third, augmented second      | 3
	Major third, diminished fourth     | 4
	Perfect fourth, augmented third    | 5
	Diminished fifth, augmented fourth | 6
	Perfect fifth, diminished sixth    | 7
	Minor sixth, augmented fifth       | 8
	Major sixth, diminished seventh    | 9
	Minor seventh, augmented sixth     | 10
	Major seventh, diminished octave   | 11
	Perfect octave, augmented seventh  | 12
	Augmented octave                   | 13

	Some convenient predefined interval objects can be found in the \c intervals namespace.

	@ingroup lharmony_intervals
	@see CompoundInterval, MicrotonalInterval, isValidQualityForKind()

	@todo throw exception in constructor if necessary
	@todo support for doubly augmented/diminished intervals?

	@todo I feel like MicrotonalInterval should have the same base class. Perhaps the Interval
	base class should have a smaller interface, and this class actually becomes DiatonicInterval
